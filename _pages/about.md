Hi, I’m NIYIBIZI Emmanuel and I specialize in Teaching Physics Secondary. I’m passionate about what I do, and I love to help people. Nothing is more fulfilling than Explaining Physics concept and carrying out Physics Experiments, and Also i like to learn more about the climate mainly Energy with aim of protecting the environment.

I am passionate about Climate protection models. I just enjoy working on new climate model. Also work as smart as possible. I love to do creative models. I am always ready to learn new things and help people, organisations and companies however due to large volume of requests, I give attention to paid requests.

I studied Bachelor of science in Teaching Physics Secondary at University of Rwanda College of Education (UR-CE) from 2013 to 2017. From 20/08/2018-01/11/2020, I was employed by Gasabo District as a permanent secondary teacher at Gs Gicaca I, Since September 2020, I'm doing Master of Mathematical science at African Institute for mathematical Sciences (AIMS-Rwanda).

Being 100% perfect in the sight of everyman is hard, but making up high quality designs is fun. I made this site so that I can balance the two.

Nothing brings me more pleasure than making something out of nothing. Even when the results are far from my ideal expectations, I find the whole ceremony of creativity completely enthralling.

I'd like to think that I'm very happy person, but I find the art that strikes me truest is the sad, depressing sort, I love Gospel and R&B music, Garden Flowers, and Trips for exploring the new environment. Go figure.
